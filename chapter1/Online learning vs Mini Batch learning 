Advantage:
Online learning updates parameters after every training example, allowing faster adaptation and enabling learning in streaming or real-time settings.

Disadvantage:
Because each update is based on a single example, the gradient estimates are noisy, leading to unstable updates and slower convergence compared to mini-batch SGD.
